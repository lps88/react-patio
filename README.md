# react-patio
My react playground, forked from a starter kit. I haven't decided what to build first!


### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.

* Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

* Run development server:

```
npm start
```

* Or you can run development server with [webpack-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard):

```
npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/`
